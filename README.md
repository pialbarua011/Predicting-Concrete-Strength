# Predicting Concrete Strength
To predict the compressive strength of concrete by using machine learning, we can approach and build regression models. In this project, I featured about 09 regression models with cross validation including random forest,gradient boost, ADA boost, KNN, Decision Tree, Support Vector etc. I want to show which regression analysis perform the best for predicting the concrete compressive strength.
## Contents
The dataset contains the materials of concrete and the compressive strength of each mix ratios. The materials are:
- Cement
- Blast furnace slag
- Flyash
- Water
- Superplasticizer
- Coarse Aggregate
- Fine Aggregate
